        <h3>Why Ecopaper Recycle Company born ?</h3>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          The Ecopaper Recycle Company born to start the concept of doing
          business together in a group as partners instead of buyers and sellers
          so that we can create something bigger than the sum of what each
          person can create their own.

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          Ecopaper Recycle Company was established by five talented colleagues
          having the same thought of creating partners rather than customers. We
          challenged the old concepts of buyers and sellers which we experienced
          in the last 2 years in the paper industry. We believe that
          opportunities increase when we help our partners win. A win for our
          partner is a win for us.
